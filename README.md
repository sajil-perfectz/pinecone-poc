# Pinecone Vector Embedding Storage & Querying

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to store and query vector embeddings using Pinecone DB. Pinecone provides a fully managed vector database optimized for scalable and fast similarity search across high-dimensional vectors.

## Features

- **Store Vector Embeddings**: Demonstrates how to store vector embeddings in Pinecone DB using a simple and efficient process.
- **Query Vector Embeddings**: Demonstrates how to query the database for nearest neighbors or similar vectors based on cosine similarity.
- **Pinecone Integration**: Step-by-step guide on integrating Pinecone with your machine learning workflows.
